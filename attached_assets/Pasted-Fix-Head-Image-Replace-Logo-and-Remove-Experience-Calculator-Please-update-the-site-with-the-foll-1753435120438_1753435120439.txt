Fix Head Image, Replace Logo, and Remove Experience Calculator

Please update the site with the following three changes:

1. ‚úÖ Fix the Headshot Image Cropping
Goal: Make sure Rodney Pattison‚Äôs head fits nicely within the card and is not cropped off.

Adjust the image or container so the headshot is centered and fully visible.

Ideal solution: Set the image to object-contain or adjust height/positioning.

If necessary, scale down or add padding/margin so it looks clean and professional across desktop and mobile.

2. ‚ùå Remove the Experience Calculator
Goal: The "Experience Calculator" feature should be removed completely.

Delete or comment out the entire Experience Calculator section, including the header, checkboxes, and cumulative experience box.

Replace it with a simple professional summary of Rodney‚Äôs travel industry experience.

üí° Suggested replacement content:

3. üßº Replace the Loveable Heart Logo
Goal: Replace the heart-shaped "Lovable" logo in the top-left nav bar.

Swap the current logo with a more appropriate one, e.g. a clean Telenational text logo or a generic travel icon.

Suggested fallback: just replace the logo with the word "Telenational" in the nav bar (white or navy text).

Bonus: Let me know if you want a custom logo created later.

Final Step: Commit the changes and deploy.
