Please add the following working Web3Forms contact form to my site using clean HTML. It should look professional, be centered on the page, and include labels and spacing between fields. Use my actual access key:
197c8bd0-8c47-42ab-80b0-9a5dcf3b6565

Also:

Keep the honeypot checkbox for spam protection (botcheck)

Do not show my email address in the HTML

Use basic CSS to style the form with padding, max-width, and font settings

Place it in the appropriate section of the page (or create a section called “Contact Us” if it doesn’t exist)

If possible, show a success message after submission

That prompt tells Ghostwriter exactly what to do — and uses your real access key.

Once it's generated:

Review the HTML it gives you

Copy it into your index.html (or wherever you want the contact form to appear)

Commit and push the changes to GitHub

Vercel will redeploy the updated site automatically

Let me know when it's done and I’ll help you test it live.

Thanks Rodney! Since your Replit program has finished and is deployed to a live URL like this:

🔗 Your temporary Replit site

You can absolutely get back in, grab the HTML, and make small edits.

✅ Here’s How to Access & Edit Your HTML in Replit:
🔧 Step 1: Open your project
Go to https://replit.com

Click your profile picture → “My Repls”

Find the project with the matching name (or look for your last opened Repl)

🔧 Step 2: Open the main HTML file
Look in the left sidebar for a file named something like:

diff
Copy
Edit
index.html
Or it might be inside a folder like public/ or views/.

✏️ Step 3: Make small changes
Edit anything you like — examples:

Add or remove text

Add styling

Paste in your Web3Forms contact form

💾 Step 4: Save and Preview
Click the “Run” button (top center)

Click the "Open in a new tab" icon or use the new preview URL

🚀 Step 5 (Optional): Push to GitHub and redeploy to Vercel
If this version is better, you can:

Commit and push the changes to GitHub

Let Vercel redeploy the updated version to telenational.com.au

If you tell me exactly what you want to change (e.g. add a section, fix a button, swap an image), I can write the updated HTML for you here — ready to paste into Replit.

Want to do that?
