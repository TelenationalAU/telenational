“World-Class Expertise Section”
Task: Remove the entire Experience Calculator component and build a new “Our Expertise” section that conveys credibility at a glance — no counters, no gimmicks, no emojis.

Our Expertise
Intro Sentence (h4 style):

“Decades of hands-on leadership across every major sector of the travel industry.”

Six Pillars (ordered list, no years, no emojis):

Pillar	Description (max 15 words)
Corporate Travel	Strategic programme design and cost-optimised, enterprise-grade travel management.
Retail Travel	High-touch consumer service and frontline retail expertise.
Group Travel	Seamless logistics for incentive groups, conferences, and large-scale movements.
Airline Operations	Deep operational know-how spanning ground handling, IROP response, and network planning support.
Escorted Tours	Culturally rich, end-to-end guided tour design and execution.
Cruise Logistics	Complete cruise-turnaround solutions, port agency liaison, and passenger movement control.

2. Design Guidelines
Element	Spec
Layout	Responsive CSS Grid (Tailwind): 2-column on desktop (grid-cols-2 gap-8), single column on mobile.
Card Style	Minimal “elevation-1” card: rounded-2xl shadow-md bg-white p-6 hover:shadow-lg transition.
Iconography	Replace emojis with subtle 24 px line-icons (lucide-react) positioned top-left inside each card.
Typography	Heading: text-3xl font-semibold text-center text-primary-900. Body: text-gray-600 leading-relaxed.
Accent	Thin 4 px gradient underline under headline (from-primary-200 to-primary-500, width 64 px, centered).
Animation	On scroll, fade-up each card (opacity-0 translate-y-4 → opacity-100 translate-y-0 via tailwind & IntersectionObserver).
Spacing	Section padding: py-16 md:py-24. Grid gap: gap-8 md:gap-12.
Background	Very light neutral (#F9FAFB) section background to visually separate from previous content.

3. Accessibility / SEO
Use semantic <section> with aria-labelledby="expertise-title".

Each pillar headline in an <h3> (within cards) for proper hierarchy.

Descriptions concise, active-voice, <160 characters for snippet friendliness.
